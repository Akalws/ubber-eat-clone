# Overview

I created a mobile app that will allow users to make any food order in whatever area or location they find themselves. This app makes use of a restaurant api to allow the users to select from a variety of meals they will want to eat. 

I created this app because I feel we need to improve the delivery service that we have. I want people to able to feel comfortable and have trust in online serveices.
